        <p>We have a number of archival collections that contain audio in various formats.  Making these available for
            research presents a number of challenges and we are currently developing a strategy to digitise and make available online.

            This resource currently contains copies of recordings made singer, composer, arranger and collector,
            Marjory Kennedy-Fraser (1857-1930).  These recordings were made in the islands of the Scottish Hebrides
            in the early 20th century.  They are currently only available in their 'raw' digitised form, until time
            and resource allows us to create enhanced versions to accompany them.
        </p><p>
            We plan to add other digitised audio to this resource in due course.</p>
