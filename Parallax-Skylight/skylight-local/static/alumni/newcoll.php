        <p>This data is a combination of two different lists drawn up by J. Robb and Hugh Watt and held at New College Library.  Together they provide the master list of students who matriculated at New College Edinburgh for the first 100 years of its existence.  These have been augmented with information drawn from <u>Annals of the Free Church of Scotland</u>, <u>Annals of the United Free Church of Scotland 1900-1929</u> and the <u>Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae</u>.</p>

        <p>It is important to remember that New College Edinburgh was founded as an independent institution, only becoming part of the University of Edinburgh in 1935. <i>( <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/divinity/about/history/">... more about the history of New College</a> )</i></p>
