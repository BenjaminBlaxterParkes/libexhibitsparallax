        <p>The foundation of this database lies in an earlier database based on the following source:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>University of Edinburgh: Medical Examinations (later Graduates in Medicine): 1833- . [Edinburgh University Library Special Collections: EUA IN1/ADS/STA/8]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As only 205 individuals were keyed into the original database, it is only a sample of those studying during that period.  The possibility of adding further names is being considered.</p>
