        <p>The University of Edinburgh Roll of Honour was published in 1921, edited by Maj. John E. Mackenzie.  It begins with an introduction by the Principal, Sir Alfred Ewing, and a poem by Rudyard Kipling.  Thereafter follows the Roll of the Fallen, Roll of War Service and, finally, Orders Decorations and Dispatches.</p>
        <p>The current data has been drawn from the Roll of the Fallen section.  This has been done via digitisation and optical character recognition, so may have minor errors.</p>
        <p>'Pl' references relate to photographic plates in the original.  These are not currently available here but can be viewed as part of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/rollofhonour191400univuoft" target=”_blank”>fully digitised volume</a> at the Internet Archive.</p>
