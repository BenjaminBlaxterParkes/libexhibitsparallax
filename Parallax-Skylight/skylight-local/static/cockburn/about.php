    <h2>History of the Cockburn Geological Museum </h2>
    <p>
    Professor Archibald Geikie, holder of the first Chair of Geology at the University, founded the museum in 1873 to facilitate student learning.
    The museum collections have been housed at the Grant Institute since its opening in 1932.
    They were named after Dr A M Cockburn, who was largely responsible for cataloguing and arranging the materials during the early years of the Institute.
    The collection has continued to grow over the years. Donations of rare specimens have provided breathtaking displays and valuable reference material for research investigations.

    <h2>Collections</h2>
    <p>
    The stored collections, amassing over 130,000 specimens, reflect the whole spectrum of earth science materials - minerals, rocks and fossils.
    They also host maps, photographs and the archived work of famous earth scientists, many of which date back as far as the late 18th century.
    Many attractive specimens from the collections are displayed in presentation cases along the main corridors of the Institute, while other material is stored but readily accessible.
