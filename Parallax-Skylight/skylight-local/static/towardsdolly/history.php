        <p>The collections catalogued as part of the ‘Towards Dolly’ and ‘Making of Dolly’ projects relate to a long history of
        animal breeding and genetics research in and around Edinburgh. Many different organisations and individuals
        have played their part; this is a brief history of just some of them.</p>

        <p>Edinburgh first became established as a centre for animal breeding through the work of James Cossar Ewart, professor
        of natural history at the University of Edinburgh between 1882-1927. As well as his pioneering cross-breeding
        experiments, Ewart also helped establish a lectureship in genetics at the University in 1911 (the first of its
        kind in Britain), to which Arthur Darbishire was appointed.</p>

        <p>Government plans to fund a national centre for animal breeding research in Edinburgh stalled during the First World War,
        but were resumed afterwards. In 1920, the Animal Breeding Research Station was established with the aim to apply
        the emerging science of genetics to the improvement
        of livestock and agricultural production. Darbishire, a natural choice for director, had died in a military camp
        in 1915, so the directorship went to one of his former students, F.A.E. Crew. Over the next two decades, the
        small experimental ‘station’ was transformed into the University’s Institute of Animal Genetics with an
        international reputation, attracting leading geneticists such as H.J. Muller to Edinburgh to carry out research.
        The work of the Institute was diverse, from classical genetics using Drosophila fruit flies to large scale
        livestock experiments. Crew was also the first Buchanan Professor of Animal Genetics at the University.</p>

        <p>Staff and resources were scarce during the Second World War, although it was in this period when Charlotte Auerbach and
        J.M. Robson made their ground-breaking discovery of the mutagenic properties of mustard gas. After the end of
        the war, it was decided that the newly formed National Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organisation
        (NABGRO, later simply ABRO) would be located in Edinburgh, under the directorship of R.G. White. A Poultry
        Research Centre (PRC) was also established under the directorship of Alan Greenwood. Both organisations were
        sponsored by the Agricultural Research Council. The ‘genetics section’ of ABRO staff, directed by C.H. Waddington,
        occupied the Institute of Animal Genetics building, while the rest of ABRO was occupied with breeding experiments
        on a variety of farms.</p>

        <div class="clearfix"></div>

        <p>By 1951, the genetics section formally separated from ABRO to become its own unit within the Institute of Animal Genetics,
        with Waddington as de facto director of the whole Institute (Crew had resigned in 1944), as well as Buchanan
        Professor of Animal Genetics.</p>

        <p>Over the following decades, the Institute housed a number of additional units, aside from the original core of University
        staff (the Department of Genetics), which conducted research in a variety of areas: from the genetic effects of
        radiation through to reproductive physiology, mutagenesis and protozoan genetics. Waddington resigned as director
        of the Unit in 1968, with Douglas Falconer his successor until the Unit was disbanded in 1980.</p>

        <p>A reorganisation in 1986 saw ABRO and most of PRC combine to form the Edinburgh Research Station of the Institute of
        Animal Physiology and Genetics Research, sponsored by the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council. The
        new Station was based at Roslin, with its sister organisation at Babraham, near Cambridge. Roger Land was
        appointed Head of Station in Edinburgh, with Grahame Bulfield taking over in 1988.</p>

        <p>In 1993, Roslin became independent from Babraham to become Roslin Institute, with Bulfield as director. A series of
        experiments to produce cloned and transgenic sheep led to Roslin becoming internationally famous in 1996, when
        Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first animal to be cloned from an adult
        body cell.</p>

        <p>The Institute of Animal Genetics was formally shut down in 1990, as part of a widespread reorganisation which gave rise
        to the University of Edinburgh’s Division (later School) of Biological Sciences. The Department of Genetics
        became part of the Institute of Cell, Animal and Population Biology, which split in 2004 to form the Institute
        of Evolutionary Biology and the Institute of Immunology & Infection Research.</p>

        <p>In 2008, <a href="http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk" title="Roslin Institute Link" target="_blank"> Roslin Institute</a>
        became incorporated with the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies within the College of
        Medicine and Veterinary Medicine of the University of Edinburgh, under the director David Hume. It moved into
        new premises on the University’s Easter Bush site in 2011, where it continues to conduct research into the
        health and welfare of animals, and applications of basic animal sciences in human and veterinary medicine, the
        livestock industry and food security.</p>
